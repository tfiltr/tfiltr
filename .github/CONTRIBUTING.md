## Want to write some code?

Sweet, We welcome programmers of all abilities to submit a PR however we need to keep thing organised so we have a few rules and guidelines we request you follow. Here the steps you should follow in preparing your PR.

### Steps

1. Find an issue or Make a new issue, and ask if anyone else is already working on that issue if not then just leave a comment that your working on the issue and you are good to move to the next step
2. Fork the repo, this allows you to work on your own copy of the repo, just besure to keep it up to date with the upstream (our repo).
3. Clone your fork and make a new branch, we prefer branch names in following format `type/topic/issue-number-issue-name` example `feat/auth/1234-new-provider`. 
That said it's your repo so it's up to you, as long as the new branch is based on the main branch (unless given prior permission to use a different branch) you are good.
4. Nice so you have a shiny new branch, time for the fun stuff, let's **code**. Now let's not get too far ahead of ourselves we still have to make commits. 
Now we like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) but again we are not strict as we will squash your commits so please be careful about including too many changes in one PR, Make your PRs as atomic as possible.
5. Update any docs and comments as required.
6. Now you get send us your work, Open a new with a title in following format `type(topic/s): issue-number-issue-name` much like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). How explain the why of your changes and note any workarounds or hacks, and besure to refer back to the original issue.
7. Be responsive, please respond to questions and requests and be patient as we will be patient with you, we all have lives outside of this project.
8. PR is merged, time to celebrate ðŸŽ‰
